This dataset is originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository on Breast Cancer. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has Breast Cancer, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
